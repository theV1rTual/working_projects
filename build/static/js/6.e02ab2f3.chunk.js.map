The\nProduction, or MES, section will be discussed subsequently to show its overall contribution\nin the big picture.  This document is based on a few typical EMS businesses. </p>\n      <p> \n      Supply Chain Management (SCM) is designed to plan and procure raw materials just in time\n(JIT), from supplier contracts for cost reduction and managing three inventory types for\nkitting, storing, and obsolescence.  We feel it is of vital importance that complete work order\nkits are ready for production, according to schedule, to minimize shop floor interruptions\nand to help with frequent inventory turnovers.\n      </p> \n      <p> <span className=\"bold\"> Material Cost and Support (+ - 70%) </span> </p> \n    <p>Material and support can range from component cost, fabrication parts, buyers, expediters,\nplanning, stockroom staff labor to maintain inventory, receiving and inspection crews, etc.\nThis is the biggest expense, which means it’s the area with the largest potential to reduce\ncosts and increase profitability. Every percent saved has the greatest impact on the bottom\nline - by reducing component costs and making white collar personnel repurposed for a\nhigher level of work. The greatest part of our design and development is spent in this\nsection to help our customers gain efficiency.</p>\n    <p>CUBE’s MRP drives Lean Manufacturing practices to ensure that purchases are made to\nreduce overall costs, reduce manual labor, and reduce handling of components in each\norder.</p>\n    <p>Current State of SCM in EMS Business</p>\n    <ul className=\"disc\">\n        <li>Greater than 70% of Total Manufacturing COSTS are in Material Management</li>\n        <li>Greater than 70% of PROFITS are derived from Material Management</li>\n        <li>A bulk of FINANCIAL LIABILITIES are tied to Material Management</li>\n        <li>Slow CASH to CASH CYCLE can decrease the ability to procure additionally needed parts\nfor growth</li>\n        <li>ON-TIME DELIVERY tied to Materials arriving on time for manufacturing is a constant\nchallenge</li>\n        <li>KIT SHORTAGES cause reduced Product Quality and Late Deliveries</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p> <span className=\"bold\"> Building Quality Product on Time (+ - 15%) </span> </p> \n    <p>The second biggest manufacturing contributor for on-time delivery, quality, and profit is in\n        production. The process of building more quality product on-time, effectively, requires\n        software tools that can help plan, schedule real-time based on continuing changes\n        throughout the day, and provide superior process control and tracking methods.  CUBE’s\n        focus in this area will not only save on expenses but will also raise customer satisfaction by\n        delivering quality products on time.</p>\n        <p>\n        In the section below, we will describe how the CUBE system, in three parts, helps to\n        contribute additional profit while increasing first-pass quality to deliver products on time.</p>\n        <p> <span className=\"bold\"> BEMS Business using CUBE System for Value Proposition </span> </p>\n        <p>The CUBE Solution has three basic strategies for lower costs & higher margins. </p> \n        <ul className=\"none\">\n        <li> A.  <span className=\"bold\">  Material</span> - reduce parts cost, inventory and obsolescence, and shortages.

Overall, the above numbers should be fairly consistent. Calculations are done on the conservative side for % of savings to show the minimal side of savings. <br/>\n*This calculation does not consider indirect and direct labor savings, bank financing interest charges, inventory carrying costs, etc. This calculation is being conservative, but depending on the agreement, the parts cost can be reduced to achieve 10% or more.   </p>\n<p> <span className=\"bold\"> Labor Savings  </span> </p>\n<p> <span className=\"bold\"> Purchasing, Contracts Management, Expediting Department  </span> </p>\n<p>The number of personnel used in this department is different for each company.

EMS companies are well aware of typical margin in providing production services \n    (typical labor service content of the product cost is much lower, as a result the contribution to the gross margin is \n    lower as well). CUBE helps to tuck here and there to run manufacturing more efficiently, \n    by providing real-time status information, easy to use software modules, and automation through our MES system. </p>\n    <p>This section’s primary contribution is Customer Satisfaction - when run efficiently to produce higher quality product\n         without interruption to deliver on time and according to schedule. Optimized machine and labor schedule \n         for most effective use will cause higher production yields (reducing idle time). It is difficult to measure each \n         item to determine the efficiency as numerous factors contribute to producing products from Work Center (WC) \n         to WC each day. Results may vary based on the production process - so the information below is provided \n         for consideration. </p>\n         <p><span className=\"bold\"> Production Engineering  </span></p>\n         <p>The following tools are available to provide and control how a production is built. \n             Part Master, Bill of Material, Engineering Change Order / Engineering Deviation Notice, \n             Electronic Work Instruction (EWI) by WC, Engineering WO Release Checklist, Work Center \n             Instruction and Verification Checklist, Statistical Quality Analytics, Corrective Action / \n             Preventative Action, and Project Manager to adjust or create production process. </p>\n             <p><span className=\"bold\"> Production Control Dashboard  </span></p>\n         <p>The dashboard is a tool for Production Control personnel to open a new WO and Track real-time status of all open WOs. It is an all-inclusive Dashboard to view Kit Shortages, who or what machine is assigned at each work center, status notice for any production constraints and other information to ensure on-time completion of all WOs. </p>\n             <p><span className=\"bold\"> Work Order Scheduling  </span></p>\n         <p>When a WO is opened with the quantity and due date, the WO Scheduling reviews Routing, time allocation for \n             setup and run time, availability of the kit while reviewing other open WOs to determine the schedule for \n             the WO automatically. The WO is tracked from the beginning to the end of the process, ensuring the due date is met. \n             If a WO is rescheduled in a WC, WO Scheduling compensates and readjusts automatically to meet the due date. </p>\n             <p><span className=\"bold\"> Work Center Scheduling PCBA and Tracking  </span></p>\n         <p>Work Center Scheduling has the ability to make last-minute production schedule changes as needed. \n             This can be accomplished with one-click adjustment. When the product moves to the next WC, \n             the WO Scheduling automatically reschedules to slow or accelerate the schedule to ensure \n             on-time completion of the product (with consideration for all other products in the production process).  </p>\n             <p>Material tracking starts from WO Kitting by Work Center in Inventory Management. \n                 The first step in Shop Floor Tracking is to assign PCBs with Serial Numbers (customer issued or internally \n                 assigned automatically). Components are tracked within the PCB by tracking what MTC part is used \n                 in a reference designator. When MTC components are consumed, it automatically decrements inventory quantity\n                  (remainder of the parts - reels, for example, are automatically counted and inventory is updated). \n                  Upon production process completion, the PCBAs are transferred to FGI Inventory with an assigned Date Code, \n                  ready for shipment or further processing to the next level. When shipping, PCBA SNs are recorded in the \n                  PL along with CofC as needed.  </p>\n                  <p>To see the details, please review the MFG, ENG, and EQS sections in the CUBE System. </p>\n                  <ul className=\"none\">\n                  C.<span className=\"bold\"> ISO Compliance & Conformance </span>  – ISO Compliance and Conformance currently uses labor without substantial benefits \n                  for most EMS companies. ISO, i4.0, TQM, Lean Manufacturing, and other philosophies and methods all try to \n                  help companies run their business more effectively. However, these methods are only as good as how they are \n                  applied with management commitment. ISO focuses on operations efficiency and repeatable consistency in \n                  operations of every department. To this end, CUBE is designed to automate the actionable parts for \n                  operational excellence. It is difficult to measure exact savings as it happens in a tangible way for \n                  some and more subtly for others. An EMS company can compare how they are maintaining ISO currently vs how CUBE, \n                  by use of the system, takes care of most of the requirements of the ISO Certification, eliminating manual work. \n               <br/>\n                <li>A company can review the ISO Certification document in the www.manex.com - EQS Section - ISO Certification \n                    document for determining how much labor time can be saved, but more importantly how ISO is actually applied to\n                     shift from daily chaos to a more planned and predictable operation. </li>\n                  </ul>\n             \n      </div>\n  );\n}"],"sourceRoot":""}
