Customers already have more options than ever, and they expect better support and value from EMS suppliers. Research shows that customers feel most EMS companies fall short of their expectations for great experiences and that it\u2019s easier than ever to plan on moving their business to another EMS. To keep customers\u2019 loyalty, EMS companies need to deliver transformative service and price competitiveness while sustaining and continuing to improve the experience.

For customers requiring ITAR, the ERP and MES system must ensure that unauthorized personnel do not have access to product information. With our CUBE system, we took all these into consideration and worked with our customers to ensure CUBE meets those requirements. This is part of the reason we incorporated ISO and merged all quality and security related subjects to create the EQS system (Enterprise Quality Management System). We also observed that the EMS industry is in the process of being disrupted in a new way to focus on Customer Satisfaction, which requires a better tuned system and operational reorganization. This requires customer and supplier partnerships (as a reality) to decrease costs, increase quality, and ensure that material flow just-in-time - using the labor force to perform a higher level of work while letting CUBE automate the routine and repeatable tasks.

Without automatically digitalized information, there will be no data foundation, a requirement for a wide array of initiatives.
