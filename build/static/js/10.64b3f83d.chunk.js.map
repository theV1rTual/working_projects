As i4.0 reshapes the future of work, businesses must prepare\n        their personnel for the new world. This often means an increased focus on continuously\n        learning new types of jobs and a commitment to diversity.</p>\n        <p>A connectivity-based manufacturing operation requires the embracing of a transformative\n        mindset for manufacturing operations to evolve the ERP, MES, and EQS - enhancing smart-\n        machine communication (data-sharing for operational excellence). Additionally, to capitalize\n        on the connected ecosystem, EMS companies must begin seamless integration and data\n        exchange with suppliers, customers, and partners. This is when operational architecture\n        plays a very critical role in eliminating the barriers between disconnected systems and\n        machines.</p>\n        <p>A connected ecosystem brings opportunities not only in automation, optimization and smart\n        manufacturing but enables manufacturers to move towards an “on demand,” highly\n        adaptable model - bridging the digital and analog to have machines working as one, such as\n        real-time monitoring operations, tracking, JIT inventory for lean manufacturing, parts\n        adjustments as consumed through machine and ERP connectivity, compensating schedules\n        for unplanned events, real-time production error prevention through SQA, and more.\n        Connectivity is the value of the internal IoT for collecting, transmitting, and leveraging\n        manufacturing data, now that Big Data is no longer optional.\n        </p>\n        <p><span className=\"bold\">  How will it affect the FUTURE of WORK? </span> </p>   \n        <p>As with previous industrial revolutions, i4.0 will profoundly affect people’s lives as AI and\nincreased automation eliminates many types of jobs while creating entirely new categories\nof work. As routine and repeatable work disappear, companies view the evolution as a job\ndestroyer. But the reality is that humans should be retrained to do creative and higher level\nof work which helps the business prosper. Prior to automation, people were used to doing\nlow levels of work, but now that is alleviated with AI and other automation techniques. This\nnew technology lets them focus on work that can only be done by humans.</p>\n<p>To future-proof the workforce, businesses will need to ensure they have the right mix of skills\nin their workforce based on the new organization chart and define what is “work” to keep\npace with changing technology. Workers will more than likely need to update their skills, not\njust once, but many times during their careers. To this end, companies need to continually\nbuild the capacity to innovate with agile workforce. When possible, avoid hiring new talent\nbut retrain existing and experienced workers who understand the company culture and\ncurrent work so they can continue to help the business thrive through deeper knowledge of\nwork.</p>\n<p>The most important technology in i4.0 is the open mind, accept new ways of working,\ndeveloping true partnerships that mutually benefit all parties with proper planning, and\nbringing together a knowledge-base to prevent unplanned difficulties. Without this human\npower, all the soft and hard technology turns into an expensive waste. So, what is i4.0? It's\nthe people, organization for new work, flexibility, an open mind, and willingness to\ncollaborate for success. Only when these are working in harmony can an EMS company and\nits partners increase value to continue their professionalism and prosper.</p>\n<p><span className=\"bold\"> i4.0 is about CUSTOMER FOCUS </span> </p>   \n<p>As technologies change what’s possible, it is also changing customers’ expectations. i4.0\nwill become ubiquitous, transforming customers’ interactions with EMS companies for a\nbetter experience. Technology is and will continue to enable EMS companies to offer greater\nservice and additional value through connected experiences online and through other\nmeans. Customers already have more options than ever, and they expect better support and\nvalue from EMS suppliers. Research shows that customers feel most EMS companies fall\nshort of their expectations for great experiences and that it’s easier than ever to plan on\nmoving their business to another EMS. To keep customers’ loyalty, EMS companies need to\ndeliver transformative service and price competitiveness while sustaining and continuing to\nimprove the experience. To accomplish this, an open book relationship must be established\nwith mutual trust where both parties are looking out for each other’s interests - true business\npartnership.</p>\n<p>As part of building a business relationship, customers regard as being “very important to\nwinning and keeping their business” are connected processes for effective communication\n(customers needs real-time access to the status of their work), a high level of quality, on-\ntime delivery, and value pricing through cooperation. This means businesses must continue\nto improve the support methods and manufacturing operations, delivering a customer\nexperience that differentiates them from competitors. At the same time, customers are\nuncomfortable with how EMS companies use their business and product information. The\nmajority of customers are more afraid of their data being compromised now than they have\never been. As a result, they are using NIST800/CMMC, as an example, as a benchmark to\nmeasure their EMS security measures.</p>\n<p>AI is fueled by data, which learns about the operation and predicts a businesses’ needs to\nact on its behalf. But as data becomes an asset to our digital lives, EMS companies must\nensure the privacy and security of customer information to satisfy and assure customers on\nhow their data is used and protected.</p>\n<p><span className=\"bold\"> How is the CUBE system provisioned for i4.0? </span> </p>   \n<p>Most EMS companies work in North America and Europe on jobs related to prototypes, pre-\nproduction, and small to medium production runs. Products they produce are generally\nMedical, Aerospace, Military, and other mission critical areas that the EMS industry serves\ntoday. These industries require a much higher level of tracking materials and a rigorous\nproduction process, along with environmental and security measurements to ensure their\ndata are kept in a secure manner, even between customers within the facility. For customers\nrequiring ITAR, the ERP and MES system must ensure that unauthorized personnel do not\nhave access to product information. With our CUBE system, we took all these into\nconsideration and worked with our customers to ensure CUBE meets those requirements.\nThis is part of the reason we incorporated ISO and merged all quality and security related\nsubjects to create the EQS system (Enterprise Quality Management System). We also\nobserved that the EMS industry is in the process of being disrupted in a new way to focus\non Customer Satisfaction, which requires a better tuned system and operational\nreorganization. This requires customer and supplier partnerships (as a reality) to decrease\ncosts, increase quality, and ensure that material flow just-in-time - using the labor force to\nperform a higher level of work while letting CUBE automate the routine and repeatable\ntasks. This is what CUBE is tasked to do.</p>\n<p>How does one adopt Industry 4.0 technologies and embody these smart manufacturing\nprinciples? CUBE has done it so the company only has to understand their goal and\nreorganize work and people to take advantage of the benefits i4.0 brings. Two key areas of\ni4.0 are digitalization of information and strategic partnerships (customers and suppliers).\nWithout automatically digitalized information, there will be no data foundation, a requirement\nfor a wide array of initiatives. Simply decreasing paper or spreadsheet processes by utilizing\nthe ERP and MES more effectively represents a first step in the right direction. When it\ncomes time to adopting innovative technologies, viewing customers and suppliers as\nstrategic partners and having a co-creation mentality is essential.</p>\n<p>Partnerships should be seen as opportunities for cutting edge technology to solve small and\nlarge problems that concrete ROIs. For instance, a customer partnership to be involved from\nthe product design process by designing in manufacturability and preferred AML that EMS\nrecommends. This requires reorganization of production engineering and training people to\nbecome customer focused - overhaul and tune the status quo of manual practices in the\nentire shop floor to take advantage of the efficiencies (manufacturability) built in during the\nproduct design stage, such as a consolidated AML for efficient parts acquisition and easier\nassembly and testability methods in EWI module. EMS companies must begin working\nclosely with customers’ sales and purchasing departments by Customer Support and\nProduction Control, working together with customers to discuss material and manufacturing\nconstraints - to plan production schedules more effectively and minimize over or under\ninventory to achieve JIT as much as possible.</p>\n<p>This partnership requires a breakdown of old habits on both sides and to develop a mutual\nand strong level of trust. Working without trust and continuing the old way of a customer/\nsupplier relationship is a path doomed to failure in the future world of relationships. Think of\ndoing this new approach as “evolution, rather than a revolution.” It will take time, but baby\nsteps must be taken to start a new path to business success.</p>\n<p>The i4.0 challenge with the current wave of technology is about creating new sources of\nvalue. In i3.0, technology was about automating what EMS companies were already doing.\nBut the new wave of technology addresses how they interact with their customers and\nsuppliers. This requires a different approach on the part of EMS service companies. “You\nare not automating what they were already doing, you are co-creating new things with i4.0”.</p>\n<p>Manufacturers often collect descriptive data (history) and diagnostic data (why did it\nhappen) about their machines and devices, but with i4.0’s end-to-end digitization, they can\nalso gain predictive (what will happen) and prescriptive (action plan through CUBE Project\nManagement and CAPA) insights into the status of their operations. With multi-directional\ndata synthesized from ever-changing sources, analytics can be communicated in real-time\nvia operational dashboards and notifications. These data insights drive progress, quality,\ncompliance, and innovation enterprise-wide, while also radically simplifying decision-making\nprocesses on a daily basis. i4.0, which connects Big Data, delivers this intelligent data\naround-the-clock for constant insight into current and future operational performance.\n</p>\n<p><span className=\"bold\"> How to become a i4.0 success? </span> </p>  \n<p>The new industrial revolution brings us opportunities from transforming the way products\nare produced, using self-maintained equipment made with new materials that can produce a\nhigher quality product and inspect defects with much higher precision. ERP, MES, EQS\nsystems incorporate AI with machines to predict, automate routine repeatable functions, and\nassist users to perform at a higher level of work. Opportunities are abounding, but it requires\na well thought out and careful strategy and planning to gain maximum benefits.

As a result, manex customers benefit by having a\nconsistent and standardized product that ensures seamless upgrades to leverage the latest\ninnovations that drive manufacturing excellence.</p>\n<p><span className=\"bold\"> Benefits of applying i4.0 are:</span> </p>   \n<ul className=\"no-style\">\n  <li>Achieve greater Customer Satisfaction  </li>\n  <li>Closer partnerships with Suppliers for JIT Inventory and Cost Reduction </li>\n  <li>Improved first-pass Quality </li>\n  <li>Improve Employee Decision Making / Competency </li>\n  <li>Increase Visibility Across Manufacturing Network </li>\n  <li>Asset Reliability - better usage of the machine resources  </li>\n  <li>Reducing Cycle Times / Lead Times </li>\n  <li>Enforcing Standard Processes / Best Practices </li>\n  <li>Regulatory Compliance / Traceability </li>\n  <li>Free up working capital for business growth.  </li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n<p>Finally, another hallmark of i4.0 is the ability to communicate and display complex processes\nin a simplified format. People want things that are simple and easy to use, but they also want\nadvanced and powerful capabilities. Many think that if something is simple then it is very\nbasic or limited in capabilities, while if something is very advanced, it is complicated and\nhard to use or understand. But it is possible that simple and easy-to-use features can co-\nexist with advanced and powerful capabilities - through intuitive interfaces, contextual\nawareness, interactive electronics work instructions, and real-time alerts, all powered by\nenhanced data-sharing. With the concept of complex simplicity, CUBE introduces tools that\nimprove productivity, keep factory workers safe, and ensure that operations remain\nproactive as opposed to reactive.</p>\n\n\n    </div>\n  );\n}"],"sourceRoot":""}
