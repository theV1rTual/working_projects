Capacity planning can be defined as the process of determining the production capacity needed by a manufacturer to meet their sales forecast. The effective use of this tool produces the maximum work that a manufacturer can complete within a period of time, with available capacity.

The ideal environment for CPS has a dedicated production line setup with high-volume production and minimal changes during the production process. This allows manufacturers to plan for raw material in advance and typically have suppliers in proximity, readily supplying material for a smooth and consistent production schedule and delivery. However, each change can cause the entire process, or part of the process, to shut down to accommodate the change, and this may take time to set up for a high-volume and repetitive production process. Therefore, once planning and scheduling is implemented, there are only minor schedule deviations from the set plan and production runs smoothly to create the specified product, using dedicated line of machines, labor, raw material, or parts that are always available just in time.  Examples of process manufacturing include plastic or metal injection molding of the same part, manufacturing screwdrivers, food and drink products, smartphones, automobile, etc. The production of these products accommodates the ideal environment for capacity planning to thrive."}),Object(i.jsx)("br",{}),Object(i.jsxs)("p",{children:[Object(i.jsx)("span",{className:"bold",children:" Electronics Manufacturing (OEM, ODM & JDM)     "})," "]}),Object(i.jsx)("p",{children:"For electronic products, OEMs usually have their own Work Orders (WOs) with single to indented complex BOMs and separate processes and work centers.

The overwhelming complexity that is involved in the production process makes traditional CPS an extremely difficult tool to implement, and even more difficult to keep, as the schedule changes many times throughout the day.

Every time a job is completed in a work center, DST automatically reprioritizes all jobs to ensure that all jobs stay on schedule as they are built.
