For EMS,\ncustomers are more sensitive to what kind of data and how their suppliers protect\nconfidential information in their ERP and MES systems. To this end, OEM customers\ndemand and want proof of how EMS secures their data, who’s allowed access to their data,\nand how they protect and prevent data leakage, theft, or alteration. </p>\n<p><span className=\"bold\" style={{color: \"#13A0FE\"}}> Who sets the stage and govern information cyber-security?   </span> </p>\n <p>The definition, framework, and process are offered by two primary industry oversight agencies. \n     They are National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Organization \n     for Standardization (ISO) - they provide the framework for information security. Most commonly, the NIST\n      Cybersecurity Framework is compared to ISO 27001: specification for an information security management system (ISMS). \n</p>\nNIST 800-171 / CMMC is more security-control-driven with a variety of groups to facilitate \nbest practices working with the DoD. ISO 27001, on the other hand, is less technical but more risk-focused for businesses.\n A common misconception is that an EMS must choose between NIST or ISO, or that one is better than the other. \n In reality, they can both be used in by EMS as they are synergistic -both are good for data security, risk assessments,\n  and security programs.  \n<p>Many organizations are turning to Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) as a means \n    of managing the multiple frameworks. COBIT helps EMS bring standards, governance, and process to cybersecurity. \n    The ultimate goal is to provide actionable risk management to an EMS’s critical infrastructure. \n</p>\n<p><span className=\"bold\" style={{color: \"#13A0FE\"}}> NIST 800-171 / CMMC  </span> </p>\n<p>The NIST 800-171 is a set of documents that describe computer security policies, procedures, and guidelines. \n    NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a unit of the Commerce Department. NIST 800 \n    Series publications are methods for optimizing IT security and networks in a proactive manner. \n    The publications cover all NIST-recommended procedures and criteria for assessing and documenting threats \n    and vulnerabilities and for implementing security measures to minimize risk. The publications can be useful \n    as guidelines for enforcement of security rules and as legal references in case of litigation involving security issues. \n    </p>\n    <p>NIST 800-171 (not linked to federal networks) is a subset of NIST 800-53 (linked to a federal system) and \n        intended to be simpler to implement than NIST 800-53.  The only requirement is the Basic section. DFARS\n         has added criteria for the NIST 800-171 / CMMC. The process of becoming NIST 800-171 “compliant” \n         is to validate that controls are in place and operational. Gap assessment can identify gaps and \n         remediation effort will get an EMS to “compliant.” If EMS needs to “prove” it more formally, a \n         first-party or third-party audit may be necessary.  \n         </p>\n         <p>\n         For ISO 27001 certified EMS, the above process should be familiar -do a Gap Assessment, \n         Gap Remediate, and then validate the effectiveness of the 800-171 implementation during \n         the Internal ISMS Audit. During the next ISO 27001 Surveillance Audit, the Registrar will in \n         effect be “certifying” the NIST 800-171 implementation. \n         </p>\n         <p><span className=\"bold\"> Understanding the Framework of NIST 800-171  </span> </p>\n<p>A checklist is important in the process to compliant/certification and maintaining the NIST 800-171. \n    The new standards encompass 14 categories of data security requirements, and each of those categories\n     includes a series of sub-standards.
