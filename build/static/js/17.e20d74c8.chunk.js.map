Occasionally, \n      a system is selected without proper preparation, although with good intentions. However, this can sometimes \n      lead to failure, causing a difficult and arduous process in search of another system. Unfortunately, \n      this causes disruption to the business with negative financial impact. \n      </p> \n      <p>\n      The purpose of this document is to help with the selection process, with steps to consider when selecting a system. \n      This can be done by creating a checklist when performing internal observation and external system reviews. \n      These insights will help when determining a software system possessing the best fit for the company.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      An additional goal of this document is for the company to perform a self-examination of current business practices \n      to determine if there are more efficient methods available. Self-examination is centered around the goal of producing \n      better products on time and increasing the company’s profitability, through an understanding of current processes and \n      methods which are important for determining the company’s needs. This evaluation will help prioritize important factors \n      during the software search. The selection team should be methodical, maintain a rational mind, and be realistic about \n      the results of what is needed. \n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Although this recommended process may take more time and effort, it ensures the selection of the right system for the company.  \n      </p>\n      <h3 className=\"sub-heading-1\"> Internal Preparation  </h3>\n      <p><span className=\"bold\"> Team Organization  </span> </p>\n      <p>\n      The first step in the process of the search is to build a team of stakeholders from each department, \n      as they will all be affected by the new system. The members of this team should recruit inside knowledge \n      from the actual users and their needs. This will provide insight and possibly new and important perspectives \n      on the requirements for a system. However, the team must understand each department’s and the company’s overall goals \n      to decipher and prioritize productive changes in the big picture. The goal of the search team is not for a select \n      group of people or certain departments to benefit but to benefit the entire enterprise. \n      </p>\n      <p><span className=\"bold\"> Why a new Manufacturing Operations Software System?   </span> </p>\n      <p>After a team has been assembled, they should start by establishing the reasons to search for new system and \n          their ultimate goal. Some questions to ask internally are: \n     </p>\n      <ul className=\"disc\">\n          <li>Does the current system no longer serve its purpose?  </li>\n          <li>Are too many users complaining about the current system, and if so, why?  </li>\n          <li>Will a new system bring better process control, deliver quality product on-time, and increase profitability? How? </li>\n          <li>What is to be accomplished with a new manufacturing operations system? List these goals as a project mission statement to help prioritize what is important. </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p><span className=\"bold\"> Project Purpose Announcement  </span> </p>\n      <p>Once the team is organized with a charter, they should make an announcement to all employees regarding plans \n          for a new system and the goal to achieve. Keep in mind that changing systems will affect the entire company, \n          whether directly or indirectly.  \n      </p>\n    <p>\n    The announcement encourages users to invest themselves in this opportunity for improvement and increases their \n    cooperation during the transitional process. Employees can provide valuable input during the internal assessment. \n    By helping them understand the purpose and big picture of the project, it opens up an opportunity for them to give \n    their honest feedback for the team to use constructively. A common goal to work towards, together, also brings comradery \n    within the company, making users more likely to cooperate with an open mind during the training process to maximize \n    the effectiveness of the new system.  \n    </p>\n    <p><span className=\"bold\"> Internal Operation Assessment, by Department   </span> </p>\n      <p> The selection team can now look at the company’s current state. Each department must make their objective assessment\n           to properly diagnose the current operational processes. This step serves as the foundation when determining which \n           system will add the most value for the company.   \n      </p>\n      <p>Users must feel at ease and understand that their input is valued and considered when gathering honest feedback on the\n         current processes or procedures. Some questions they could be asked are: </p>\n         <ul className=\"disc\">\n             <li>If they want to improve a certain process, why do they feel change is needed, and how do they want \n                 to see the change implemented?  </li>\n             <li>If they like a certain process, what do they like about it and what would they want to keep? </li>\n         </ul>\n        <p> It is imperative for users to understand this is not a time to complain or place blame but is a neutral ground \n            to objectively present what can be optimized in the current software. To do this, selection team members should be \n            assigned to different departments that are not their own to get an objective assessment. Based on employee feedback,\n             the team can then determine which input is useful in improving performance in each department.  \n            </p>\n        <p> By assessing the company’s current processes, the selection team can determine departmental and overall company \n                 strengths and areas that can be optimized. With this information, a checklist of software requirements can be \n                 created for suppliers about specific features needed in their software system. \n            </p>\n            <p><span className=\"bold\"> Requirements List  </span> </p>\n            <p>When creating the checklist, the selection team should consider what the biggest cost factors are in running \n               a manufacturing business. Based on industry consensus, they can be categorized as follows: \n            </p>\n            <ol>\n                <li>  <p><span className=\"bold\"> Material Cost and Support (+- 70%) </span> </p> Material and support can range from component cost, fabrication parts, buyers, expediters, planning, stockroom \n                    staff to maintain inventory, the receiving crew, etc. This is, by far, the biggest expense, meaning it’s the area \n                    with the largest potential to increase profitability. Every percent saved has the greatest impact on the bottom line, \n                    by reducing component costs and making white collar personnel more efficient. When evaluating a new potential system,\n                     this area must take precedence when determining how to increase profit.   </li>\n                <li> <p><span className=\"bold\"> Building Quality Product on Time (+- 10%)   </span> </p> The process of building more quality product on-time effectively requires a system that can help plan and \n                    schedule properly, through superior process control methods. Use the information gathered from the assessment \n                    process to identify areas that can be more productive. Focusing on this area will not only save on expenses\n                     but will also raise customer satisfaction.  </li>\n                <li> <p><span className=\"bold\"> General Administration & Maintenance Cost (G&A) (+- 20%)  </span> </p> </li>\n                <li><p><span className=\"bold\"> Cost of Doing Business   </span> </p> ERP and MES software packages generally do not address government and industry compliances for safety, environmental, \n                    and manufacturing standards in the EMS industry. A system that keeps track of and maintains standards to comply with ISO-9001, \n                    ISO-13485, AS9100, RoHS, ITAR, and more is extremely beneficial to minimize manual maintenance and effort. \n                    The selection team should ask how suppliers are able to accommodate these requirements.  </li>\n            </ol>\n            <p><span className=\"bold\"> Accepting Changes </span> </p>  \n            <p> For a new system to perform at its best, some existing job functions and processes must be adjusted. \n                Thus, it is imperative for all users to have an open mind to optimize current methods when implementing a system. \n                Some users may resist change, and as a result, may want to keep their original methods with the previous system - \n                attempting to bend the new system to accommodate that process. Therefore, it is necessary for all employees to give full \n                support with a willingness to change for the betterment of the company. Otherwise, the company may have to settle on a \n                new system that only provides modest improvement than what is currently being used. \n            </p>\n            <h3 className=\"sub-heading-1\"> External Preparation  </h3>\n            <p><span className=\"bold\"> External Assessment </span> </p>  \n            <p>The purpose of an external assessment is to find a software system that will help achieve the goals created \n                by the internal assessment. Keep in mind that the initial requirement is to find software that serves the \n                needs of the electronics manufacturing environment.  \n            </p>\n            <p><span className=\"bold\"> Definition of ERP, MES, and BRM </span> </p>  \n            <p>The definitions below provide a broad picture of areas covered by each category of the manufacturing \n                operations software system. \n                </p>\n                <p> <span className=\"cursiv\"> Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) -  </span> </p> \n                <ol>\n                    <li>Sales Forecasting, Sales, Price Sheet, and Customer Information </li>\n                    <li>Materials Planning and Procurement Management (Supply Chain Management) </li>\n                    <li>Accounting </li>\n                </ol>\n                <p> <span className=\"cursiv\"> Manufacturing Execution System (MES) -    </span> </p> \n                <ol>\n                    <li>Capacity Analysis, Production Scheduling, Shop Floor Management, and Production Quality Control </li>\n                    <li>Manufacturing and Process Engineering </li>\n                    <li>Accounting </li>\n                </ol>\n                <p> <span className=\"cursiv\"> Business Relationship Management (BRM) -   </span> </p> \n                <p> Various utility software apps used for internal communication (email, chat, etc), project and task management,\n                electronic document filing systems, and various other specialty software to help run the business in the modern \n                digital age. These apps augment the use of ERP and MES systems.\n                </p>\n                <p><span className=\"bold\"> First Pass Supplier Selection  </span> </p> \n                <p>Demos take time, and after reviewing several options, all systems can start to sound the same – causing the company \n                    to overlook important details. To prevent this, the selection team should execute a general filtering process from \n                    a large list of suppliers for the first phase. This first cut  will allow the team to focus on promising suppliers \n                    and perform an effective evaluation of the during the demo review. \n                     </p>\n                <p>Interview all possible suppliers directly via calls or email, or send out a Request for Information \n                    with a questionnaire. During the initial interview phase, it is important to state only the company’s \n                    function and that they are in the manufacturing business. The purpose is not to keep secrets,\n                     but to prevent the possibility of suppliers using detailed information provided to manufacture \n                     or manipulate answers to meet the company requirements. The last thing a buyer needs to \n                     hear are packaged answers on what they may want to hear. By withholding this information, \n                     the team will be able to fairly assess each possible supplier, preventing the company \n                     from being blindsided after purchase. \n                     </p>\n                     <p>Here are some possible questions the selection team may ask software companies to obtain \n                         relevant information needed during the first phase: </p>\n                         <ol>\n                             <li>Which areas of the software system excel in optimizing efficiency, and in which areas do  \n                                 they satisfy or meet basic needs? Keep in mind that each company has their own personality\n                                and areas in which they focus, due to the experience and background of the founders and \n                                executives.\n                                <ul className=\"circle\">\n                                    <li> Example: One supplier may be strong in Accounting and Sales, but may offer minimal benefits \n                                        in material management.

Scheduling for \n                            longer demo sessions could also be disruptive for team members as they have daily tasks needing \n                            attention throughout the day.
