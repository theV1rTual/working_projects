        We understand that once you select a system, you want to get it up and running right away.
With manex, you don't need to teach us about your industry because we are from your
industry. We have worked in and with the industry since the 1980s, so we speak your
language. manex is easy to learn, easy to use. It’s a no-nonsense system you can use
quickly and efficiently. To help you get started as fast as possible, we have:

implementation process from the start to finish - until you’re fully operational for both
CUBE ERP and MES systems </li>
                   <li>A structured implementation planner/guide that provides step-by-step guidelines for a
successful implementation</li>
                   <li>A default system setup EMS template provided to reduce initial data entry </li>

something - all training is included in the cost of the monthly CUBE subscription. No
additional charge EVER.
      </p> 
      <h3 className="sub-heading-1">CONSULTING</h3>
      <p>

meet customer requirements – we got you covered. We have experience from thousands of
business case studies/scenarios in our pocket and this where we can help our customers all
