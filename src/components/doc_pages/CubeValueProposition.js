      <h2 className="heading-1"> CUBE System Value Proposition</h2>
      
      <p>
      The industry consensus for the biggest Manufacturing Cost factor for running an EMS
business is in Material Management – so our focus will be in the Supply Chain section. The
Production, or MES, section will be discussed subsequently to show its overall contribution
in the big picture.  This document is based on a few typical EMS businesses. </p>
      <p> 
      Supply Chain Management (SCM) is designed to plan and procure raw materials just in time
(JIT), from supplier contracts for cost reduction and managing three inventory types for
kitting, storing, and obsolescence.  We feel it is of vital importance that complete work order
kits are ready for production, according to schedule, to minimize shop floor interruptions
and to help with frequent inventory turnovers.
      </p> 
      <p> <span className="bold"> Material Cost and Support (+ - 70%) </span> </p> 
    <p>Material and support can range from component cost, fabrication parts, buyers, expediters,
planning, stockroom staff labor to maintain inventory, receiving and inspection crews, etc.
This is the biggest expense, which means it’s the area with the largest potential to reduce
costs and increase profitability. Every percent saved has the greatest impact on the bottom
line - by reducing component costs and making white collar personnel repurposed for a
higher level of work. The greatest part of our design and development is spent in this
section to help our customers gain efficiency.</p>
    <p>CUBE’s MRP drives Lean Manufacturing practices to ensure that purchases are made to
reduce overall costs, reduce manual labor, and reduce handling of components in each
order.</p>
    <p>Current State of SCM in EMS Business</p>
    <ul className="disc">
        <li>Greater than 70% of Total Manufacturing COSTS are in Material Management</li>
        <li>Greater than 70% of PROFITS are derived from Material Management</li>
        <li>A bulk of FINANCIAL LIABILITIES are tied to Material Management</li>
        <li>Slow CASH to CASH CYCLE can decrease the ability to procure additionally needed parts
for growth</li>
        <li>ON-TIME DELIVERY tied to Materials arriving on time for manufacturing is a constant
challenge</li>
        <li>KIT SHORTAGES cause reduced Product Quality and Late Deliveries</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <span className="bold"> Building Quality Product on Time (+ - 15%) </span> </p> 
    <p>The second biggest manufacturing contributor for on-time delivery, quality, and profit is in
        production. The process of building more quality product on-time, effectively, requires
        software tools that can help plan, schedule real-time based on continuing changes
        throughout the day, and provide superior process control and tracking methods.  CUBE’s
        focus in this area will not only save on expenses but will also raise customer satisfaction by
        delivering quality products on time.</p>
        <p>
        In the section below, we will describe how the CUBE system, in three parts, helps to
        contribute additional profit while increasing first-pass quality to deliver products on time.</p>
        <p> <span className="bold"> BEMS Business using CUBE System for Value Proposition </span> </p>
        <p>The CUBE Solution has three basic strategies for lower costs & higher margins. </p> 
        <ul className="none">
        <li> A.  <span className="bold">  Material</span> - reduce parts cost, inventory and obsolescence, and shortages. To achieve
this goal, it is essential that the EMS establishes a 3-way alliance between suppliers and
customers.</li>
        <li> B. <span className="bold">   Engineering and Production </span>  - “do it right the first time” methodology through analytics
and continuous improvement. Decrease errors, reduce unplanned schedule changes, and
prepare proper instructional documentation.</li>
        <li> <span className="bold"> C.   ISO Compliance & Conformance </span> - process automation and reduce indirect labor costs. </li>
        </ul>
   <p>Each of these items in A - D are addressed below:</p>
     <ul className="none">
         <li> <span className="bold"> A.   Material </span> - Approximate Purchased Parts Cost Reduction for annual supplier contracts –
this is based on a discount-by-commodity, based on $12M - $200M in annual EMS sales
revenue. Based on sales, EMS spends an average of 58% - 68% for material purchase costs
(we used 60% as the base for all revenue categories). </li>
<li>Of the 60% total material acquisition costs, we estimated approximately 50% for acquisition
of customer specific custom parts, such as PCBs, custom IC or Substrate, mechanical, and
other specialized parts unique to a finished good product account. Non-Custom electronics
and electro-mechanical parts account for the other 50% of acquisition costs. Contracts
Procurement from this Non-Custom can bring substantial cost savings from materials. See
below for possible savings from non-contract electronics and electro-mechanical parts.</li>
</ul> 
<p> <span className="bold"> $12M Annual Revenue 	 <br/>
$12M x 60% = $7.2M - represents total annual material purchasing cost </span> </p>
    <p>$7.2M is divided by 2 for Non-Custom parts, which is $3.6M (50% of $7.2M) <br/>
$3.6M with a 5% discount (we estimated this category at 5% because the total material buying power is lower)  </p>
<p> <span className="bold"> Net annual cost saving = $204,000 	</span> </p>
<br/>
<p> <span className="bold"> $24M Annual Revenue	 <br/>
$24M x 60% = $14.4M - represents total annual material purchasing cost  </span> </p>
    <p>$14.4M is divided by 2 for Non-Custom parts, which is $7.2M (50% of $14.4M)  <br/>
    $500K with a 7% discount (we estimated this category at 7% because the total material buying power is higher)   </p>
<p> <span className="bold"> Net annual cost saving = $504,000</span> </p> <br/>
<p> <span className="bold"> $50M Annual Revenue <br/>
$50M x 60% = $30M - represents total annual material purchasing cost </span> </p>
    <p>$30M is divided by 2 for Non-Custom parts, which is $15M (50% of $30M)   <br/>
    $15M with an 8% discount (we estimated this category at 8% because the total material buying power is higher)    </p>
<p> <span className="bold"> Net annual cost saving = $1,200,000 </span> </p> <br/>
<p> <span className="bold"> $200M Annual Revenue <br/>
$200M x 60% = $120M represents total annual material purchasing cost   </span> </p>
    <p>$120M is divided by 2 for Non-Custom parts which is $60M (50% of $120M).   <br/>
    $60M with a 10% discount (we estimated this category at 10% because the total material buying power is higher)    </p>
<p> <span className="bold"> Net annual cost saving = $6,000,000 </span> </p>
      <p>*These numbers may vary depending on whether purchases contain more cable, box build, or focus on PCA assembly. Overall, the above numbers should be fairly consistent. Calculations are done on the conservative side for % of savings to show the minimal side of savings. <br/>
*This calculation does not consider indirect and direct labor savings, bank financing interest charges, inventory carrying costs, etc. This calculation is being conservative, but depending on the agreement, the parts cost can be reduced to achieve 10% or more.   </p>
<p> <span className="bold"> Labor Savings  </span> </p>
<p> <span className="bold"> Purchasing, Contracts Management, Expediting Department  </span> </p>
<p>The number of personnel used in this department is different for each company. These are some of the considerations for estimating the time currently used vs how much time can be reduced, based on the restructuring of work. </p>
<ul className="disc">
    <li>MRP’s ability to consolidate purchase requirements for all customers, then AML scrubbing to reduce approximately 70% of POs and number of lines in each PO </li>
    <li>Customer consigned material requirements are calculated and produces $0 POs </li>
    <li>Use of Contracts Management will reduce between 30% - 70% of manual POs. Contracted parts POs are issued automatically by the system without the aid of the buyer </li>
    <li>Real-time status dashboard and automatic Buyer Action communication between Receiving and Buyer will eliminate the majority of manual communication, including the RMA/DMR </li>
    <li>Automated PO history displays purchase costs by supplier for each part for ease of finding and purchasing material </li>

</p>
<ul className="disc">
    <li>Over 50% of the material receiving and inspection requirements are reduced, as a bulk of the requirements are consolidated during the purchase order process </li>

    <li>The ability to multi-kit during one pass by work center, instead of kitting each work order separately </li>
</ul>
<ul className="none">
    <li>B. <span className="bold"> Engineering and Production </span>- CUBE System’s Manufacturing & Production Execution System (MES) - its Goal is to gain Efficiency, Agility, and Reliability to Deliver Quality Products On-Time to achieve Customer Satisfaction. </li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, an EMS company runs two businesses 1) Material Management for creating Production Kits and 
    2) Consigned Production Service Management. EMS companies are well aware of typical margin in providing production services 
    (typical labor service content of the product cost is much lower, as a result the contribution to the gross margin is 
    lower as well). CUBE helps to tuck here and there to run manufacturing more efficiently, 
    by providing real-time status information, easy to use software modules, and automation through our MES system. </p>
    <p>This section’s primary contribution is Customer Satisfaction - when run efficiently to produce higher quality product
         without interruption to deliver on time and according to schedule. Optimized machine and labor schedule 
         for most effective use will cause higher production yields (reducing idle time). It is difficult to measure each 
         item to determine the efficiency as numerous factors contribute to producing products from Work Center (WC) 
         to WC each day. Results may vary based on the production process - so the information below is provided 
         for consideration. </p>
         <p><span className="bold"> Production Engineering  </span></p>
         <p>The following tools are available to provide and control how a production is built. 
             Part Master, Bill of Material, Engineering Change Order / Engineering Deviation Notice, 
             Electronic Work Instruction (EWI) by WC, Engineering WO Release Checklist, Work Center 
             Instruction and Verification Checklist, Statistical Quality Analytics, Corrective Action / 
             Preventative Action, and Project Manager to adjust or create production process. </p>
             <p><span className="bold"> Production Control Dashboard  </span></p>
         <p>The dashboard is a tool for Production Control personnel to open a new WO and Track real-time status of all open WOs. It is an all-inclusive Dashboard to view Kit Shortages, who or what machine is assigned at each work center, status notice for any production constraints and other information to ensure on-time completion of all WOs. </p>
             <p><span className="bold"> Work Order Scheduling  </span></p>
         <p>When a WO is opened with the quantity and due date, the WO Scheduling reviews Routing, time allocation for 
             setup and run time, availability of the kit while reviewing other open WOs to determine the schedule for 
             the WO automatically. The WO is tracked from the beginning to the end of the process, ensuring the due date is met. 
             If a WO is rescheduled in a WC, WO Scheduling compensates and readjusts automatically to meet the due date. </p>
             <p><span className="bold"> Work Center Scheduling PCBA and Tracking  </span></p>
         <p>Work Center Scheduling has the ability to make last-minute production schedule changes as needed. 
             This can be accomplished with one-click adjustment. When the product moves to the next WC, 
             the WO Scheduling automatically reschedules to slow or accelerate the schedule to ensure 
             on-time completion of the product (with consideration for all other products in the production process).  </p>
             <p>Material tracking starts from WO Kitting by Work Center in Inventory Management. 
                 The first step in Shop Floor Tracking is to assign PCBs with Serial Numbers (customer issued or internally 
                 assigned automatically). Components are tracked within the PCB by tracking what MTC part is used 
                 in a reference designator. When MTC components are consumed, it automatically decrements inventory quantity
                  (remainder of the parts - reels, for example, are automatically counted and inventory is updated). 
                  Upon production process completion, the PCBAs are transferred to FGI Inventory with an assigned Date Code, 
                  ready for shipment or further processing to the next level. When shipping, PCBA SNs are recorded in the 
                  PL along with CofC as needed.  </p>
                  <p>To see the details, please review the MFG, ENG, and EQS sections in the CUBE System. </p>
                  <ul className="none">
                  C.<span className="bold"> ISO Compliance & Conformance </span>  – ISO Compliance and Conformance currently uses labor without substantial benefits 
                  for most EMS companies. ISO, i4.0, TQM, Lean Manufacturing, and other philosophies and methods all try to 
                  help companies run their business more effectively. However, these methods are only as good as how they are 
                  applied with management commitment. ISO focuses on operations efficiency and repeatable consistency in 
                  operations of every department. To this end, CUBE is designed to automate the actionable parts for 
                  operational excellence. It is difficult to measure exact savings as it happens in a tangible way for 
                  some and more subtly for others. An EMS company can compare how they are maintaining ISO currently vs how CUBE, 
                  by use of the system, takes care of most of the requirements of the ISO Certification, eliminating manual work. 
               <br/>
                <li>A company can review the ISO Certification document in the www.manex.com - EQS Section - ISO Certification 
                    document for determining how much labor time can be saved, but more importantly how ISO is actually applied to
                     shift from daily chaos to a more planned and predictable operation. </li>
