      <h2 className="heading-1"> ERP and MES SELECTION PROCESS </h2>
      <p className="data">July 1, 2020</p>
      <h3 className="sub-heading-1"> Introduction </h3>
      <br/>
      <p> 
      When a company selects and implements a manufacturing business operations software system, 
      the goal is to use the system for decades, working towards continuous progress, and to succeed in its endeavors. 
      Therefore, it is worthwhile to allocate proper resources and time preparing for an acquisition. Occasionally, 
      a system is selected without proper preparation, although with good intentions. However, this can sometimes 
      lead to failure, causing a difficult and arduous process in search of another system. Unfortunately, 
      this causes disruption to the business with negative financial impact. 
      </p> 
      <p>
      The purpose of this document is to help with the selection process, with steps to consider when selecting a system. 
      This can be done by creating a checklist when performing internal observation and external system reviews. 
      These insights will help when determining a software system possessing the best fit for the company.
      </p>
      <p>
      An additional goal of this document is for the company to perform a self-examination of current business practices 
      to determine if there are more efficient methods available. Self-examination is centered around the goal of producing 
      better products on time and increasing the company’s profitability, through an understanding of current processes and 
      methods which are important for determining the company’s needs. This evaluation will help prioritize important factors 
      during the software search. The selection team should be methodical, maintain a rational mind, and be realistic about 
      the results of what is needed. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Although this recommended process may take more time and effort, it ensures the selection of the right system for the company.  
      </p>
      <h3 className="sub-heading-1"> Internal Preparation  </h3>
      <p><span className="bold"> Team Organization  </span> </p>
      <p>
      The first step in the process of the search is to build a team of stakeholders from each department, 
      as they will all be affected by the new system. The members of this team should recruit inside knowledge 
      from the actual users and their needs. This will provide insight and possibly new and important perspectives 
      on the requirements for a system. However, the team must understand each department’s and the company’s overall goals 
      to decipher and prioritize productive changes in the big picture. The goal of the search team is not for a select 
      group of people or certain departments to benefit but to benefit the entire enterprise. 
      </p>
      <p><span className="bold"> Why a new Manufacturing Operations Software System?   </span> </p>
      <p>After a team has been assembled, they should start by establishing the reasons to search for new system and 
          their ultimate goal. Some questions to ask internally are: 
     </p>
      <ul className="disc">
          <li>Does the current system no longer serve its purpose?  </li>
          <li>Are too many users complaining about the current system, and if so, why?  </li>
          <li>Will a new system bring better process control, deliver quality product on-time, and increase profitability? How? </li>
          <li>What is to be accomplished with a new manufacturing operations system? List these goals as a project mission statement to help prioritize what is important. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><span className="bold"> Project Purpose Announcement  </span> </p>
      <p>Once the team is organized with a charter, they should make an announcement to all employees regarding plans 
          for a new system and the goal to achieve. Keep in mind that changing systems will affect the entire company, 
          whether directly or indirectly.  
      </p>
    <p>
    The announcement encourages users to invest themselves in this opportunity for improvement and increases their 
    cooperation during the transitional process. Employees can provide valuable input during the internal assessment. 
    By helping them understand the purpose and big picture of the project, it opens up an opportunity for them to give 
    their honest feedback for the team to use constructively. A common goal to work towards, together, also brings comradery 
    within the company, making users more likely to cooperate with an open mind during the training process to maximize 
    the effectiveness of the new system.  
    </p>
    <p><span className="bold"> Internal Operation Assessment, by Department   </span> </p>
      <p> The selection team can now look at the company’s current state. Each department must make their objective assessment
           to properly diagnose the current operational processes. This step serves as the foundation when determining which 
           system will add the most value for the company.   
      </p>
      <p>Users must feel at ease and understand that their input is valued and considered when gathering honest feedback on the
         current processes or procedures. Some questions they could be asked are: </p>
         <ul className="disc">
             <li>If they want to improve a certain process, why do they feel change is needed, and how do they want 
                 to see the change implemented?  </li>
             <li>If they like a certain process, what do they like about it and what would they want to keep? </li>
         </ul>
        <p> It is imperative for users to understand this is not a time to complain or place blame but is a neutral ground 
            to objectively present what can be optimized in the current software. To do this, selection team members should be 
            assigned to different departments that are not their own to get an objective assessment. Based on employee feedback,
             the team can then determine which input is useful in improving performance in each department.  
            </p>
        <p> By assessing the company’s current processes, the selection team can determine departmental and overall company 
                 strengths and areas that can be optimized. With this information, a checklist of software requirements can be 
                 created for suppliers about specific features needed in their software system. 
            </p>
            <p><span className="bold"> Requirements List  </span> </p>
            <p>When creating the checklist, the selection team should consider what the biggest cost factors are in running 
               a manufacturing business. Based on industry consensus, they can be categorized as follows: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>  <p><span className="bold"> Material Cost and Support (+- 70%) </span> </p> Material and support can range from component cost, fabrication parts, buyers, expediters, planning, stockroom 
                    staff to maintain inventory, the receiving crew, etc. This is, by far, the biggest expense, meaning it’s the area 
                    with the largest potential to increase profitability. Every percent saved has the greatest impact on the bottom line, 
                    by reducing component costs and making white collar personnel more efficient. When evaluating a new potential system,
                     this area must take precedence when determining how to increase profit.   </li>
                <li> <p><span className="bold"> Building Quality Product on Time (+- 10%)   </span> </p> The process of building more quality product on-time effectively requires a system that can help plan and 
                    schedule properly, through superior process control methods. Use the information gathered from the assessment 
                    process to identify areas that can be more productive. Focusing on this area will not only save on expenses
                     but will also raise customer satisfaction.  </li>
                <li> <p><span className="bold"> General Administration & Maintenance Cost (G&A) (+- 20%)  </span> </p> </li>
                <li><p><span className="bold"> Cost of Doing Business   </span> </p> ERP and MES software packages generally do not address government and industry compliances for safety, environmental, 
                    and manufacturing standards in the EMS industry. A system that keeps track of and maintains standards to comply with ISO-9001, 
                    ISO-13485, AS9100, RoHS, ITAR, and more is extremely beneficial to minimize manual maintenance and effort. 
                    The selection team should ask how suppliers are able to accommodate these requirements.  </li>
            </ol>
            <p><span className="bold"> Accepting Changes </span> </p>  
            <p> For a new system to perform at its best, some existing job functions and processes must be adjusted. 
                Thus, it is imperative for all users to have an open mind to optimize current methods when implementing a system. 
                Some users may resist change, and as a result, may want to keep their original methods with the previous system - 
                attempting to bend the new system to accommodate that process. Therefore, it is necessary for all employees to give full 
                support with a willingness to change for the betterment of the company. Otherwise, the company may have to settle on a 
                new system that only provides modest improvement than what is currently being used. 
            </p>
            <h3 className="sub-heading-1"> External Preparation  </h3>
            <p><span className="bold"> External Assessment </span> </p>  
            <p>The purpose of an external assessment is to find a software system that will help achieve the goals created 
                by the internal assessment. Keep in mind that the initial requirement is to find software that serves the 
                needs of the electronics manufacturing environment.  
            </p>
            <p><span className="bold"> Definition of ERP, MES, and BRM </span> </p>  
            <p>The definitions below provide a broad picture of areas covered by each category of the manufacturing 
                operations software system. 
                </p>
                <p> <span className="cursiv"> Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) -  </span> </p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>Sales Forecasting, Sales, Price Sheet, and Customer Information </li>
                    <li>Materials Planning and Procurement Management (Supply Chain Management) </li>
                    <li>Accounting </li>
                </ol>
                <p> <span className="cursiv"> Manufacturing Execution System (MES) -    </span> </p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>Capacity Analysis, Production Scheduling, Shop Floor Management, and Production Quality Control </li>
                    <li>Manufacturing and Process Engineering </li>
                    <li>Accounting </li>

                <p> <span className="cursiv"> Business Relationship Management (BRM) -   </span> </p> 
                <p> Various utility software apps used for internal communication (email, chat, etc), project and task management,
                electronic document filing systems, and various other specialty software to help run the business in the modern 
                digital age. These apps augment the use of ERP and MES systems.
                </p>
                <p><span className="bold"> First Pass Supplier Selection  </span> </p> 
                <p>Demos take time, and after reviewing several options, all systems can start to sound the same – causing the company 
                    to overlook important details. To prevent this, the selection team should execute a general filtering process from 
                    a large list of suppliers for the first phase. This first cut  will allow the team to focus on promising suppliers 
                    and perform an effective evaluation of the during the demo review. 
                     </p>
                <p>Interview all possible suppliers directly via calls or email, or send out a Request for Information 
                    with a questionnaire. During the initial interview phase, it is important to state only the company’s 
                    function and that they are in the manufacturing business. The purpose is not to keep secrets,
                     but to prevent the possibility of suppliers using detailed information provided to manufacture 
                     or manipulate answers to meet the company requirements. The last thing a buyer needs to 
                     hear are packaged answers on what they may want to hear. By withholding this information, 
                     the team will be able to fairly assess each possible supplier, preventing the company 
                     from being blindsided after purchase. 
                     </p>
                     <p>Here are some possible questions the selection team may ask software companies to obtain 
                         relevant information needed during the first phase: </p>
                         <ol>
                             <li>Which areas of the software system excel in optimizing efficiency, and in which areas do  
                                 they satisfy or meet basic needs? Keep in mind that each company has their own personality
                                and areas in which they focus, due to the experience and background of the founders and 
                                executives.
                                <ul className="circle">
                                    <li> Example: One supplier may be strong in Accounting and Sales, but may offer minimal benefits 
                                        in material management. Another may be strong in manufacturing operations management but 
                                        not in material management, etc.) </li>
                                </ul>
                                 </li>
                             <li>What is the background of the founder(s) and which industry/industries do they derive their experience? 
                                 This particular question will offer insightful information needed to fully understand which industry 
                                 the software can serve best. </li>
                             <li>What makes the potential supplier’s software unique? What are their highlights and 
                                 how would they affect current business operations? </li>
                         </ol>
                         <p>The questions above, in addition to the Requirements List, will allow the selection team
                            to eliminate suppliers who are less relevant to the industry and business. </p>
                            
                            <h3 className="sub-heading-1"> Software Demo and Selection Process  </h3>   
                    <p>The selection team should use their Requirements List to provide potential suppliers with a must-have
                        hot list of their business needs. This ensures the potential supplier addresses all priority areas in the company. 
                        Potential suppliers must be able to demonstrate solutions to this list in addition to what the software can do best. 
                        A checklist can be used during the product demo. 
                        </p>
                        <p><span className="bold"> Product Demonstration  </span> </p> 
                        <p>When scheduling demos, remember that effective demos should be in blocks of approximately 2 hours 
                            to cover a section at a time, as it is difficult to absorb all information at once. Scheduling for 
                            longer demo sessions could also be disruptive for team members as they have daily tasks needing 
                            attention throughout the day. The goal should be to learn about software capabilities that may 
                            have been unknown to the company, but also to separate "flashy” features from what is truly beneficial 
                            to the business. The selection team should be weary of falling into the trap of "nice things to have” 
                            that may be less relevant to the actual goal.
                             </p> 
                           <p> The following is a list of what the potential supplier should be able to address, supplementing the checklist: </p>
                           <ol>
                               <li>Demonstrate practical solutions to the issues described in the Requirements List, 
                                   and whether the potential supplier understands the company’s business and its needs? </li>
                               <li>How difficult will it be for company employees to learn and use the system? If it is difficult to learn,
                                    users may resist change and it may cause unnecessary errors and entering incorrect data, etc. </li>
                               <li>How much of the work process does the system automate? How much manual work is still necessary to get the job done? </li>
                               <li>What is their approach to industry-specific manufacturing compliance requirements, such as ISO, NIST800/CMMC, 
                                   RoHS, EAR, REACH, CA65, ITAR, DPAS, conflict minerals, and many others?  </li>
                               <li>What modules are available within the system, and what makes each module tailored for the company’s business needs? </li>
                               <li>Is there a list of standard and optional modules (optional module list for review) or do they offer an 
                                   all-inclusive full system? If optional modules are available separately, 
                                   what will be the additional costs down the road? </li>
                               <li>What does the supplier offer for software maintenance and support? 
                                   Are there any additional costs for these services? How does the supplier accommodate for implementation of their system? </li>
                           </ol>
                           <p><span className="bold"> Demo Assessment  </span> </p> 
                           <p>When evaluating which system offers the best solutions specific to department and company goals, 
                               prejudice or personal preference must be left behind. Consider which system is easier 
                               to use while solving specific needs.  
                               </p>
                               <p>What processes and/or procedures need to change?  
                                Is it necessary to rearrange of some positions to adapt to the system if it brings benefits? 
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                 Implementing without addressing these questions first risks users attempting to bend and twist the 
                                 new system to the method they are accustomed to. Users who are unaware of necessary adjustments or 
                                 users who are unwilling to make adjustments will hinder the effort to attain superior efficiency and continuous growth.  
                                 </p>
                            <p>  Some systems may require a significant amount of change within the company, 
                                     but it is important to recognize if the resulting benefits outweigh the temporary inconvenience. 
                                     However, if changes yield proportionally small benefits, then the system may not be the right system for the company.

                            <p>Before committing to a software system, it is important for the company to understand

                                for the implementation process, estimating the length of time and work needed to go live with the system.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>The selection team should ask how the supplier manages implementation and user training, and how.  </p>

                                          to successfully implement the system?  </li>
                                     <li>What tools are available for converting the data from the company’s current system to the new system?  </li>
                                     <li>Do these tools offer date mapping and scrubbing before the transfer? </li>
                                 </ul>
                                 <p><span className="bold"> Customization and Enhancements  </span> </p> 
                                 <p>The team should also understand how the supplier handles custom requests and associated charges.
                                      What is the policy for custom program validity and delivery to ensure that it performs properly, 
                                      and if a warranty is provided for bugs fixes after delivery.  </p>
                                      <p>If custom programming is performed internally, will the supplier provide the necessary information, 
                                          including any available tools for linking the two applications? Is there a fee for this service? </p>
                                    <p>If consultation is needed to create workarounds to complete a specific job, the selection team should consider 
                                        how the supplier understands the situation to find a solution. Ask them to go through a typical procedure 
                                        for this service. </p>
                                    <p>Inquire about the way enhancement requests are processed, specific to the company. 
                                        How does the potential supplier process suggestions regarding their software when provided 
                                        with a solution that is deemed important to the company. </p>
                                        <p>Ideally, the best approach would be for the supplier to do all of the above without additional costs, 
                                            with these services integrated into the system as part of the support and update services. 
                                            What is the likelihood of this happening under what circumstances and how frequently does this occur? </p>
                                            <p><span className="bold"> Training (initial and ongoing) </span> </p> 
                                    <p>No matter how good a system performs after implementing, continuous software updates, training, 
                                        and consultation are required to prevent the system from becoming underutilized or misused. 
                                        Neglecting proper maintenance of the system can cause decreased efficiency, late deliveries,
                                         and increased quality issues. Therefore, the selection team should ask the supplier how user 
                                         training and maintenance persists after implementation.  </p>
           <p><span className="bold"> Training (initial and ongoing) </span> </p>    
           <p>This stage sets the foundation for how the company will adapt to the new software system. 
               User proficiency developed during system setup and  implementation will determine 
               if the company will be able to utilize the system to its fullest potential. 
               The direct link between the initial user training and how much of the system can be used 
               to optimize business operations makes it imperative for the selection team to understand
                how the supplier offers training. </p>  
         <p><span className="bold"> Refresher, Ongoing, and New Employee Training  </span> </p>   
         <p>A common pattern found in manufacturing companies is that they usually acquire a new software systems every 7-10 years.
              There are typically two major reasons that cause this repeated and major endeavor: </p>    
              <ol>
                  <li>New employees who are hired after the system is implemented have no prior knowledge or experience with the system 
                      in use. Oftentimes, they learn over the shoulders of existing users, bypassing proper training from the supplier 
                      themselves. Unfortunately this causes user proficiency to fall over time, leading overall productivity and 
                      performance to fall as well. With each subsequent employee turnover, user proficiency continues to decline. 
                      After the 3rd or 4th employee turnovers, user proficiency in the system may go down by 50% or more compared 
                      to the people who originally received training. </li>
                      <li>The software system itself may continue to evolve as the supplier routinely adds enhancements or 
                          changes to improve. However, if users are not informed and trained to take advantage of these changes,
                           the improvements made in the system are not properly utilized, defeating the purpose of updating the 
                           system.  </li>
             </ol>    
             <p>The result is typically when employee satisfaction drops with the current system, 
                 as they begin to believe that the system is inadequate, and the company is then forced 
                 to assess the situation. Being unaware of many of the system’s new and improved features, 
                 the software is often the first to be scrutinized as users point out “flaws” in the system. 
                  </p>
                  <p>In order to continue the effective use of the current system and to avoid any unnecessary changes, 
                      it is essential for a company to maintain continuous training along with software updates. 
                      Assuming that the software system selected is developed by a supplier who provides quality software 
                      that offers high value, ongoing training helps to maintain a trusting, long-term partnership. 
                      A supplier who shares the drive to continually improve and succeed will grow with the company, 
                      offering assistance in areas deemed crucial. In light of this, it is extremely important to ask 
                      potential suppliers about the training services they offer. 
                      </p>
            <p>Switching to a new software system can be a financially draining and time-consuming process for the company, 
                which can sometimes be easily prevented with ongoing training. </p>
                <p><span className="bold"> Ongoing Software Support  </span> </p>   
                <p>Since the EMS industry is a specialized area within electronics manufacturing, it is also important that the software 
                    supplier understands the industry language and knows the needs of the EMS company. Users who are in need of assistance 
                    need access to a support team who has a basic understanding of their processes and industry needs, allowing them
                     to focus on finding a solution to the issue at hand. 
                     </p>
            <p>The supplier must also be able to provide the company with regular updates to their system, along with explanations of 
                what they updated and how the newest release will improve upon their software. The selection team should pay attention 
                to which areas the supplier focuses on improving and if those enhancements are directly beneficial to the company. 
                The software must evolve with its customers to satisfy the changing needs and requirements of the EMS industry.

                 <h3 className="sub-heading-1"> Value Proposition and Final Decision  </h3> 
                 <p>The goal is to achieve a high-value, quality software product that addresses 
                     the three most important aspects of the electronics manufacturing business:  </p> 
            <ol>
                <li>Material Planning and Inventory Management to achieve the highest possible profits. Some possible options are: 
                    <ul className="disc">
                        <li>Setting up supplier contracts to get better pricing and consistent on-time delivery, in-plant 
                            store to have inventory availability and pay-on-consumption to improve availability and cashflow </li>
                        <li>Reduce acquisition cost through planning and procurement </li>
                        <li>Reduce warehouse management costs through automation and 
                            visibility to accurate and real-time information </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>To produce the repeatable high-quality product on time and gain additional business through customer satisfaction:
                <ul className="disc">
                        <li>Prepare better production documents to build high quality products from the beginning and to avoid mistakes </li>
                        <li>Plan and schedule jobs more efficiently to deliver on time at a lower cost </li>
                        <li>Track production orders efficiently to reduce the need of production meetings </li>
                        <li>Measure performance for continuous improvement </li>
                    </ul>
                     </li>
                <li>To meet and maintain manufacturing compliance requirements within the system </li>
            </ol>
            <p><span className="bold"> Efficiency </span> </p>  
            <p>How will the level of efficiency within the company change in comparison to its current level? 
                The right software will be able to produce improvements in this area. </p>    
                <p><span className="bold"> Organization Process Change  </span> </p>  
            <p>Is this change in software worthwhile and profitable? The selection team should examine whether the change is making 
                a significant difference and offering true value to the company. Sometimes changes are made in hopes of improving 
                for the future, but the end result may not output the expected or intended value for the company. 
                It is up to the selection team to determine whether any changes will be productive actions or distractions.  
                </p>  
            <p>For the company’s final thoughts, the selection team should analyze how a newly implemented system will improve 
                current operations and save resources for each department. The team should make a goal to maximize the number 
                of processes or steps that can be reduced or eliminated from the current process. A high-value system will be
                 able to automate several processes, not only to make everyone’s jobs easier, but to save employees valuable 
                 time and resources.  </p>
            <p>Can the new system reduce material acquisition and labor cost? 
                The answers to this question and the ones provided above will play a substantial 
                role in deciding on a software company. </p>
