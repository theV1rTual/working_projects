      <p className="data">EVERYTHING CONNECTED for EFFICIENCY and CUSTOMER SATISFACTION </p>
      <p><span className="bold" style={{color: "#13A0FE"}}> Continued evolution of disruption and automation towards lights out manufacturing.

      <p><span className="bold">  What is the 4th Industrial Revolution for the EMS company? </span> </p>
      <p>The Fourth Industrial Revolution (i4.0) is the blurring of boundaries between the physical, digital, and technological workforce. 
        It’s a fusion of advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), RPA, robotics, Internet of Things (IoT), 3D printing, quantum computing, 
        and others. i4.0 is the collective force behind many machines and data analytics that are quickly becoming indispensable. 
        As a result of a perfect storm of technologies, i4.0 is paving the way for transformative changes in the way we work and
         do business, disrupting the EMS industry.  </p>
      <p>Computer and machine automation will come together in an entirely new way with machines
        and ERP, MES, and EQS software learning algorithms that can learn and control production
        with very little input from human operators. i4.0 introduces what has been called the ‘smart
        factory’, in which cyber-physical systems monitor the physical processes of the factory and
        make decentralized decisions. As i4.0 reshapes the future of work, businesses must prepare
        their personnel for the new world. This often means an increased focus on continuously
        learning new types of jobs and a commitment to diversity.</p>
        <p>A connectivity-based manufacturing operation requires the embracing of a transformative
        mindset for manufacturing operations to evolve the ERP, MES, and EQS - enhancing smart-
        machine communication (data-sharing for operational excellence). Additionally, to capitalize
        on the connected ecosystem, EMS companies must begin seamless integration and data
        exchange with suppliers, customers, and partners. This is when operational architecture
        plays a very critical role in eliminating the barriers between disconnected systems and
        machines.</p>
        <p>A connected ecosystem brings opportunities not only in automation, optimization and smart
        manufacturing but enables manufacturers to move towards an “on demand,” highly
        adaptable model - bridging the digital and analog to have machines working as one, such as
        real-time monitoring operations, tracking, JIT inventory for lean manufacturing, parts
        adjustments as consumed through machine and ERP connectivity, compensating schedules
        for unplanned events, real-time production error prevention through SQA, and more.
        Connectivity is the value of the internal IoT for collecting, transmitting, and leveraging
        manufacturing data, now that Big Data is no longer optional.
        </p>
        <p><span className="bold">  How will it affect the FUTURE of WORK? </span> </p>   
        <p>As with previous industrial revolutions, i4.0 will profoundly affect people’s lives as AI and
increased automation eliminates many types of jobs while creating entirely new categories
of work. As routine and repeatable work disappear, companies view the evolution as a job
destroyer. But the reality is that humans should be retrained to do creative and higher level
of work which helps the business prosper. Prior to automation, people were used to doing
low levels of work, but now that is alleviated with AI and other automation techniques. This
new technology lets them focus on work that can only be done by humans.</p>
<p>To future-proof the workforce, businesses will need to ensure they have the right mix of skills
in their workforce based on the new organization chart and define what is “work” to keep
pace with changing technology. Workers will more than likely need to update their skills, not
just once, but many times during their careers. To this end, companies need to continually
build the capacity to innovate with agile workforce. When possible, avoid hiring new talent
but retrain existing and experienced workers who understand the company culture and
current work so they can continue to help the business thrive through deeper knowledge of
work.</p>
<p>The most important technology in i4.0 is the open mind, accept new ways of working,
developing true partnerships that mutually benefit all parties with proper planning, and
bringing together a knowledge-base to prevent unplanned difficulties. Without this human
power, all the soft and hard technology turns into an expensive waste. So, what is i4.0? It's
the people, organization for new work, flexibility, an open mind, and willingness to
collaborate for success. Only when these are working in harmony can an EMS company and
its partners increase value to continue their professionalism and prosper.</p>
<p><span className="bold"> i4.0 is about CUSTOMER FOCUS </span> </p>   
<p>As technologies change what’s possible, it is also changing customers’ expectations. i4.0
will become ubiquitous, transforming customers’ interactions with EMS companies for a
better experience. Technology is and will continue to enable EMS companies to offer greater
service and additional value through connected experiences online and through other
means. Customers already have more options than ever, and they expect better support and
value from EMS suppliers. Research shows that customers feel most EMS companies fall
short of their expectations for great experiences and that it’s easier than ever to plan on
moving their business to another EMS. To keep customers’ loyalty, EMS companies need to
deliver transformative service and price competitiveness while sustaining and continuing to
improve the experience. To accomplish this, an open book relationship must be established
with mutual trust where both parties are looking out for each other’s interests - true business
partnership.</p>
<p>As part of building a business relationship, customers regard as being “very important to
winning and keeping their business” are connected processes for effective communication
(customers needs real-time access to the status of their work), a high level of quality, on-
time delivery, and value pricing through cooperation. This means businesses must continue
to improve the support methods and manufacturing operations, delivering a customer
experience that differentiates them from competitors. At the same time, customers are
uncomfortable with how EMS companies use their business and product information. The
majority of customers are more afraid of their data being compromised now than they have
ever been. As a result, they are using NIST800/CMMC, as an example, as a benchmark to
measure their EMS security measures.</p>
<p>AI is fueled by data, which learns about the operation and predicts a businesses’ needs to
act on its behalf. But as data becomes an asset to our digital lives, EMS companies must
ensure the privacy and security of customer information to satisfy and assure customers on
how their data is used and protected.</p>
<p><span className="bold"> How is the CUBE system provisioned for i4.0? </span> </p>   
<p>Most EMS companies work in North America and Europe on jobs related to prototypes, pre-
production, and small to medium production runs. Products they produce are generally
Medical, Aerospace, Military, and other mission critical areas that the EMS industry serves
today. These industries require a much higher level of tracking materials and a rigorous
production process, along with environmental and security measurements to ensure their
data are kept in a secure manner, even between customers within the facility. For customers
requiring ITAR, the ERP and MES system must ensure that unauthorized personnel do not
have access to product information. With our CUBE system, we took all these into
consideration and worked with our customers to ensure CUBE meets those requirements.
This is part of the reason we incorporated ISO and merged all quality and security related
subjects to create the EQS system (Enterprise Quality Management System). We also
observed that the EMS industry is in the process of being disrupted in a new way to focus
on Customer Satisfaction, which requires a better tuned system and operational
reorganization. This requires customer and supplier partnerships (as a reality) to decrease
costs, increase quality, and ensure that material flow just-in-time - using the labor force to
perform a higher level of work while letting CUBE automate the routine and repeatable
tasks. This is what CUBE is tasked to do.</p>
<p>How does one adopt Industry 4.0 technologies and embody these smart manufacturing
principles? CUBE has done it so the company only has to understand their goal and
reorganize work and people to take advantage of the benefits i4.0 brings. Two key areas of
i4.0 are digitalization of information and strategic partnerships (customers and suppliers).
Without automatically digitalized information, there will be no data foundation, a requirement
for a wide array of initiatives. Simply decreasing paper or spreadsheet processes by utilizing
the ERP and MES more effectively represents a first step in the right direction. When it
comes time to adopting innovative technologies, viewing customers and suppliers as
strategic partners and having a co-creation mentality is essential.</p>
<p>Partnerships should be seen as opportunities for cutting edge technology to solve small and
large problems that concrete ROIs. For instance, a customer partnership to be involved from
the product design process by designing in manufacturability and preferred AML that EMS
recommends. This requires reorganization of production engineering and training people to
become customer focused - overhaul and tune the status quo of manual practices in the
entire shop floor to take advantage of the efficiencies (manufacturability) built in during the
product design stage, such as a consolidated AML for efficient parts acquisition and easier
assembly and testability methods in EWI module. EMS companies must begin working
closely with customers’ sales and purchasing departments by Customer Support and
Production Control, working together with customers to discuss material and manufacturing
constraints - to plan production schedules more effectively and minimize over or under
inventory to achieve JIT as much as possible.</p>
<p>This partnership requires a breakdown of old habits on both sides and to develop a mutual
and strong level of trust. Working without trust and continuing the old way of a customer/
supplier relationship is a path doomed to failure in the future world of relationships. Think of
doing this new approach as “evolution, rather than a revolution.” It will take time, but baby
steps must be taken to start a new path to business success.</p>
<p>The i4.0 challenge with the current wave of technology is about creating new sources of
value. In i3.0, technology was about automating what EMS companies were already doing.
But the new wave of technology addresses how they interact with their customers and
suppliers. This requires a different approach on the part of EMS service companies. “You
are not automating what they were already doing, you are co-creating new things with i4.0”.</p>
<p>Manufacturers often collect descriptive data (history) and diagnostic data (why did it
happen) about their machines and devices, but with i4.0’s end-to-end digitization, they can
also gain predictive (what will happen) and prescriptive (action plan through CUBE Project
Management and CAPA) insights into the status of their operations. With multi-directional
data synthesized from ever-changing sources, analytics can be communicated in real-time
via operational dashboards and notifications. These data insights drive progress, quality,
compliance, and innovation enterprise-wide, while also radically simplifying decision-making
processes on a daily basis. i4.0, which connects Big Data, delivers this intelligent data
around-the-clock for constant insight into current and future operational performance.
</p>
<p><span className="bold"> How to become a i4.0 success? </span> </p>  
<p>The new industrial revolution brings us opportunities from transforming the way products
are produced, using self-maintained equipment made with new materials that can produce a
higher quality product and inspect defects with much higher precision. ERP, MES, EQS
systems incorporate AI with machines to predict, automate routine repeatable functions, and
assist users to perform at a higher level of work. Opportunities are abounding, but it requires
a well thought out and careful strategy and planning to gain maximum benefits. Review
below for some suggestions for success.</p> 
<p><span className="bold"> Organization </span> </p>  
<ul className="no-style">
  <li>Review the business charter and goals and adjust for i4.0 </li>
  <li>Review Current Operation and update the Organization Chart v</li>
  <li>People Assignment with new Organization Chart </li>
  <li>Training program to use the new Organization Chart</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p><span className="bold"> Customer </span> </p>   
<ul className="no-style">
  <li>Become part of the Sales and Purchasing department as part of the team for schedule planning </li>
  <li>Become part of the Engineering department as part of the team for manufacturability and cost reduction </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p><span className="bold"> Suppliers and Partners</span> </p>   
<ul className="no-style">
  <li>Arrange Partnerships through commitments and contracts </li>
  <li>Share MRP requirements and forecasts as they become available </li>
  <li>Setup up preferred alternate sources </li>
</ul> <br/>
<p><span className="bold"> SUMMARY</span> </p>  
<p>CUBEs integrated a suite of software modules to support EMS manufacturing without
customization, providing EMS companies with tools to improve every aspect of their
operations and enable i4.0 capabilities. As a result, manex customers benefit by having a
consistent and standardized product that ensures seamless upgrades to leverage the latest
innovations that drive manufacturing excellence.</p>
<p><span className="bold"> Benefits of applying i4.0 are:</span> </p>   
<ul className="no-style">
  <li>Achieve greater Customer Satisfaction  </li>
  <li>Closer partnerships with Suppliers for JIT Inventory and Cost Reduction </li>
  <li>Improved first-pass Quality </li>
  <li>Improve Employee Decision Making / Competency </li>
  <li>Increase Visibility Across Manufacturing Network </li>
  <li>Asset Reliability - better usage of the machine resources  </li>
  <li>Reducing Cycle Times / Lead Times </li>
  <li>Enforcing Standard Processes / Best Practices </li>
  <li>Regulatory Compliance / Traceability </li>
  <li>Free up working capital for business growth.  </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Finally, another hallmark of i4.0 is the ability to communicate and display complex processes
in a simplified format. People want things that are simple and easy to use, but they also want
advanced and powerful capabilities. Many think that if something is simple then it is very
basic or limited in capabilities, while if something is very advanced, it is complicated and
hard to use or understand. But it is possible that simple and easy-to-use features can co-
exist with advanced and powerful capabilities - through intuitive interfaces, contextual
awareness, interactive electronics work instructions, and real-time alerts, all powered by
enhanced data-sharing. With the concept of complex simplicity, CUBE introduces tools that
improve productivity, keep factory workers safe, and ensure that operations remain
proactive as opposed to reactive.</p>
